# sdd — quick guide

Spec-driven work on Azure DevOps items. One folder per work item. Scripts do the mechanics; you
make the decisions.

## The steps

**1. Set up once**
- `/sdd init` — checks tools, config and CLAUDE.md. Asks before each fix.

**2. Pull the specs**
- `/sdd sync <epic id>` — the epic and everything under it.
- `/sdd sync` — refresh everything already synced.
- `/sdd sync all` — every item in every ADO project in `.claude/sdd.json`.

**3. Check the blast radius**
- `/sdd impact <id>` — what else the item touches, and the gap questions that raises.
- `/sdd impact all` — the same for the whole spec (`/sdd impact all <epic id>` for one epic). ⚠️ Costly: it shows a token estimate and asks first.

**4. Do the work**
- `/sdd <id>` — Bug or Issue → bug flow. Story, feature or epic → spec flow.
- `/sdd bug <id>` — force the bug flow.
- `/sdd spec <id>` — force the spec flow.
- `/sdd <id> short` — a small spec item: one stop approves the design and the tasks together. `full` keeps every stop. Say neither and the flow asks.

**5. Check on it**
- `/sdd status <id>` — where it stands: ADO state, the step the flow reached, tasks done, PRs.
- Started in another chat? `/sdd <id>` offers to resume where it stopped.

**6. Finish or stop**
- `/sdd done <id>` — after the PRs merge and the work item is closed out. Shows what goes, then asks.
- `/sdd abandon <id>` — stop an item and clean up what it created. Asks before anything outward-facing.
- Both refuse, and say why, when the item is not in the right state.

**Harness**
- `/sdd harness audit` — is the Claude Code setup (CLAUDE.md, allowlists, hooks) complete and current? Reports, changes nothing.
- `/sdd harness create` / `onboard` / `maintain` — set up a repo or workspace, add a new repo to it, or fix drift.

**Help**
- `/sdd help` — this page.

**Update sdd**
Get the newest version from a chat. Type each line with a `!` in front, so it runs as a shell command:
1. `!claude plugin marketplace update sdd` — pulls the newest marketplace list.
2. `!claude plugin update sdd@sdd` — updates the plugin.
3. Run `/reload-plugins`, or start a new chat, so the new version loads.

## Where things live

Work item folder: `.claude/worktrees/<id>-<slug>/`
- `src/<Repo>/` — your code. Every edit, build, test and commit happens here.
- `graph/` — code graph of `src/`. Start with `GRAPH_REPORT.md`.
- `workitem.json` — which repo is on which branch, its PR, and where the flow stopped.

Spec folder: `specRoot` in `.claude/sdd.json`, then `**/<id>-<TYPE>-<slug>/` (TYPE: EPIC, FEAT, US, TS, CR, PBI, BUG, ISSUE)
- `requirements.md` — mirror of ADO. Never edit it; the sync overwrites it.
- `questions.md` — open questions for the item's author, one `- [ ]` line each. While any is open, the flow stops at **Open Questions** and asks them one by one; you can answer "Continue with this open" to go on anyway.
- `design.md`, `tasks.md`, `impact.md` — yours. The sync never touches them.
- `.index/spec.db` (at the spec folder root) — search index.

## Rules

- The flow stops for your approval before code changes, before a PR, and before cleanup.
- Every question comes as a pick-list, with links to the spec documents and code it is about.
- Say **abandon** at any point to stop and clean up.
- Specs change in ADO, not in the files: fix the work item, then `/sdd sync`.
- Never edit in the main checkout. Only in `src/<Repo>/`.

## A typical first session

1. `/sdd init` — say yes to the fixes you want.
2. `/sdd sync <your epic id>` — confirm when it says how many folders it writes.
3. `/sdd impact <a story id>` — read `impact.md`, decide what to do with the questions.
4. `/sdd <that story id>` — the flow claims the item and walks you through it.
