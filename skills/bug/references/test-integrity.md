# Regression test integrity

The regression test is the deliverable that outlives the fix. It has one job: **fail if this defect
ever comes back.** A test that would have passed before the fix does not do that job.

## Where the test goes

**Derive the test projects from the repo you are fixing. Never carry a list from another repo.**

```bash
git ls-files '*.csproj' | grep -iE 'test|spec'
```

Read the result:

| Project name | What it is | Use it for |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `*.{Layer}.UnitTest` | the unit tests for one layer | the regression test |
| `*.ArchUnitTest` | NetArchTest layer-boundary rules | never edit it — it must stay green |
| `*.IntegrationTest`, `*LoadTests` | slower, or not a test project at all | not the regression test |

The common shape is `{Solution}.{Layer}.UnitTest`, one project per layer. Some repos cover fewer
layers, and some have no test project at all. Check. Do not assume.

In a **UI repo** there are no `.csproj` files. Look for `*.test.ts` or `*.test.tsx` beside the source
file, and read `package.json` for the test runner and its script name.

Put the test in the project matching the layer that holds the cause. A defect in a service goes in
the Application unit tests, not in a Presentation test that reaches it through three layers.

**No unit-test project for the layer you need?** Say so at the approval gate rather than inventing
a project or shoving the test somewhere unrelated. Adding a test project is a scope change.

## Frameworks available

**Read what the repo already uses. Never add a package so you can write a test.** Open the test
project's `.csproj` and look at its `PackageReference` entries.

Common in these repos: xUnit with `xunit.runner.visualstudio`, **Moq** for fakes, and
NetArchTest.Rules in the ArchUnit project.

**FluentAssertions is usually absent.** Check before you reach for it. Fall back to `Assert.Equal`,
`Assert.Throws` and the rest of the xUnit set.

## Naming

Files: `{ClassUnderTest}Tests.cs` — `BillingLedgerServiceTests.cs`, `ChatServiceTests.cs`.

Methods: `{Method}_{ExpectedBehaviour}_{Condition}`, and the house style already leans on a
`_Not{WrongBehaviour}` suffix that names the defect directly — ideal for a regression test:

```
GetExternalUsageAsync_QueriesUsageThroughFirstDayOfNextMonth_NotLastDayOfBillingMonth
GetExternalUsageAsync_DoesNotLeakIntoNextDay_WhenBillingClosedMidMonthWithEndOfDayTimestamp
ProcessChatMessageAsync_FallsBackToOrganisationDefault_WhenAgentKeyEmptyAndNoAssistantChats
```

Name the test after the *defect*, so a future failure explains itself. Reference the work item in
an XML comment or a short `//` comment above it, not in the method name.

## The red → green → revert protocol

All of it runs **inside the worktree** (`<workspace root>\.claude\worktrees\{id}-{slug}\src\{Repo}`),
never in the main checkout. A fresh worktree has no `bin/`/`obj/`, so the first run is a cold build — don't
pass `--no-build` until something has been built at least once.

### 1. Red (Phase 6, before the fix)

```bash
dotnet test <solution> --filter "FullyQualifiedName~<TestName>"
```

It must fail. **Read the failure output** and confirm it is an *assertion* failure with a sensible
expected-vs-actual. These mean the test is broken, not the code, and must be fixed first:

- `NullReferenceException` — an unconfigured Moq dependency, not the defect
- compile error — obviously
- `Unable to resolve service for type…` — missing DI/fixture setup
- `Moq.MockException: … invocation failed with mock behavior Strict`
- the test passes — you have not encoded the defect at all; the assertion is wrong or too weak

Save the failure message verbatim. It goes in the PR.

### 2. Green (Phase 8)

Same command after the fix. It must pass.

### 3. Revert-check — the one that catches tautologies

Undo **only the source fix**, keeping the test, and re-run. The test must go red again.

```bash
git stash push -- <changed source files>
dotnet test <solution> --filter "FullyQualifiedName~<TestName>"   # must FAIL
git stash pop
```

Stash the *source* paths explicitly — `git stash` with no pathspec takes the test too and the check
becomes meaningless. If the test still passes without the fix, it is not guarding the defect;
rewrite it.

## Flakiness

### The repeat run

xUnit 2.x has no `--repeat-until-failure`, so loop it. Any variation across runs means flaky:

```powershell
1..5 | ForEach-Object {
  dotnet test <solution> --filter "FullyQualifiedName~<TestName>" --no-build |
    Select-String -Pattern 'Passed!|Failed!'
}
```

Then run the **whole** affected project once more — a test that passes in isolation but fails in the
suite is the classic shared-state flake, and the filter run would never show it.

### Causes to rule out before declaring it stable

| Smell | Why it flakes | Do instead |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `DateTime.Now` / `UtcNow` | midnight, month-end, DST, CI in another zone | inject the clock or pass explicit dates |
| `Guid.NewGuid()` in an assertion | value differs per run | fixed GUID constants |
| `Random` without a seed | different path per run | fixed seed |
| `Task.Delay` / `Thread.Sleep` to sequence | timing-dependent on a loaded agent | await the actual task; assert on state, not elapsed time |
| real DB, HTTP, or file system | shared UAT data, network, ordering | Moq the interface |
| `static` mutable state, or a `[Collection]` fixture | xUnit runs test *classes* in parallel — another class mutates it mid-run | per-test instances; no statics |
| depends on another test having run | execution order is not guaranteed | make each test self-contained |
| culture-sensitive parsing/formatting | agent locale differs | `CultureInfo.InvariantCulture` |
| asserts on collection order from an unordered source | dictionary/EF ordering is not stable | order explicitly, or assert set-wise |

### Concurrency defects need honesty

Some real defects are races. One real example: two users pulled the same chat at the same moment. A
test for a race is *inherently* timing-dependent, and looping it 5× proves little. Say so at the
approval gate: prefer restructuring the test to assert the guard directly (e.g. that the
check-before-assign call happens) over trying to reproduce the interleaving.

## Full suite

```bash
dotnet test <solution>
```

Runs unit + ArchUnit projects and skips `LoadTests/` (a console app). ArchUnit failures mean a
layer-boundary violation in your fix — they surface at **test** time, not compile time, so a green
build says nothing about them.

Pre-existing unrelated failures: report them as pre-existing, don't fold them into your fix and
don't claim the suite is green when it isn't. `NU190x` package-vulnerability warnings are
pre-existing noise and not caused by your change.
